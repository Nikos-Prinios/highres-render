# highres-render
Swap low to high resolution image textures when rendering (Blender)

Just put the low resolution images in the same folders of your high resolution images. Use only the low res when texturing. Then, when rendering, Blender will pick the high resolutions instead.

Name your low resolution images like this : low_name.jpg
The associated highres would be : name.jpg

That's it.
